1. I have defined God as the greatest conceivable being.

2. Are you saying our inability to properly verify the existence of something is an argument against its existence? So if we cannot properly verify that any specific person from a tribe exists that we can therefore conclude that no person from the tribe ever existed? Or before the discovery of the neutrino that we could conclude that neutrinos do not exist because we cannot observe them?

3. Why do humans have this special place in your perspective as the arbiters of all truth? Whereby if a human is not able to perceive of something that it therefore does not exist.

And it doesn't matter how untenable you find it, it's literally what the people who disagree with you believe. 

I get that your job would be a lot easier if your atheists would just believe and defend the simple argument that you want to have, but (for the most part) they just don't.

Atheists lack a belief in God. That is all. If you want to refute that belief, the onus is on you to prove that there is a God. 

No appeal to authority about ""what most philosophers reject"" changes that.

You may or may not believe it but in the end it won't impact your current life, discussions around it would if that was a popular subject to talk about or had a following but the fact itself would be just as meaningless as trying to argue if it exists or not.

As for God, your own definition is: ""I define God as the greatest conceivable being.""

The idea of ""greatness"" is ontologically meaningless, unless you mean sheer size. The same goes for other attributes of god: Most good, the ultimate truth, the ultimate prefection, the all-knowing being etc.

These qualities are purely subjective and do not make sense in objective reality outside human perception.

So, the question is: ""does the Greatest Conceivable Being exists?"" and the answer is obviously: no, because that question is nonsensical.

TLDR: You can't claim god's existence unless the definition of god is finite and non-paradoxical. Illogical beings cannot exist."

I was asking if the same is true of science or if you are going to commit the fallacy of special pleading for science. 

>The idea of ""greatness"" is ontologically meaningless, unless you mean sheer size. The same goes for other attributes of god: Most good, the ultimate truth, the ultimate prefection, the all-knowing being etc.

By making churches tax exempt, there is tax revenue, and therefore my taxes are higher (even if it's only an extra penny). 

I don't deny that churches can do good but if all their money goes towards providing assistance to the homeless and such then they will be able to maintain their tax exempt status without needing a spread of religion clause. "
384,dup42fb,7zm3q5,0.062,CMV: Religious institutions shouldn't be tax exempt,"I get the principle angle, but is principle really worth closing down (potentially) hundreds and maybe thousands of churches across the nation that are working on a shoestring budget right now? Again, communities will suffer as a result of this.

The only time I really volunteered at homeless shelters (sadly) is when I was a kid and went to church regularly with my parents. I think my story is not uncommon, either. 

I'm just challenging you to consider all the negative consequence you're going to drive as a result of personal principle.

The feed the homeless organization would still be tax exempt because it is operated for the exempt purpose and the non-exempt effect is simple incidental. 

I fully support programs for addicts remaining tax exempt. They are welcome to argue that any spread of religion is incidental. If they make a compelling argument, great. If they fail, then perhaps they need to rework their program to not include religion. It's not like the 12 steps were particularly effective anyway."

In fact, it's easier for most people/organizations to pay a cost spread out over than all up front. Regardless, gun ownership does have a recurring cost in license renewal. 

The analogy doesn't need to be 100% the same, I see no significant differences. 

Another analogy that might suit you better is that in order to assemble in protest you need a permit, and in many places that comes with a non-refundable application fee. Here is an example of the government actively putting a paywall in-front of exercising a first amendment right."

Well, without morals, life is just a cruel game of thrones and power, about who can squeeze the most out of it before someone else backstabs them.  There's might still be moral people in such societies, but they usually end up with their heads on pikes to be shown off to their own daughters.

That being said, taxing religions at the base rate everyone else pays shouldn't be a problem. I fully understand priest need to eat, but so does everyone else. The government should subsidize religion by making exception to the law to benefit them. When a religious institution doesn't pay taxes, that tax burden gets shifted to everyone else.

In the majority of states, homeschooled children do not fall under that umbrella. Parents don't have an actual duty to vaccinate their children, even setting the religious exemption aside. 

As for the religious exemption, it is exceedingly rare for us to impose an affirmative duty to violate your religion, even where other people's lives/wellbeing are at stake. See, e.g., religious exemptions for the draft and religious nonprofits getting waivers to not provide birth control under the ACA.

So with this in mind could you explain why you want to see parents punished if their kid dies, but not if it merely gets infected or merely is under risk of infection? Shouldnt you ask to simply make vaccines mandatory?

Probably the most common motive is anger/revenge.  That's why most shooters choose a target relevant to them: their school, their workplace, their house, a church used by the race they hate, a nightclub they went to.

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4.

I learned a ton from the internship, got a few professional trainings paid for, and the recommendations I got helped me get my first federal job and later, a prestigious graduate fellowship.

This is a tricky situation - a morally gray area - where the assumptions underlying the drinking are particularly salient.

But it also depends on your culture. The norm in some cultures require the guest to first refuse several times before finally giving in and accepting. The host is expected to continue to offer and attempt to convince the guest until they accept. The guest in these situations often wants to drink, but must be polite and first refuse. This is especially true if the guest is a woman. It would be seen as rude or stingy for the host not to ask the guest several times if they would want a drink.

Depression is a problem, laziness is a shitty human trait. IMO, treating a lazy person with ""compassion and empathy"" will only make them shittier humans

Not saying that all parents who spank their kids are monsters or even necessarily ""bad"" parents, but spanking is only a lazy ""tool"" (for lack of a better word) to get around remedying a kid's behavior in the long run.
Spanking a kid doesn't tell a kid *why* not to engage in a behavior; it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior, which might temporarily fix the problem, but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong, model correct behavior, reward for good behavior, and discipline them properly only if it continues, then that will correct it in their head.

As I said... I'm not too sure. That's why I am discussing alimony. That is, a continuous payment from one party to the other. For other cases, it's very dependent.

Imagine a person who saved money for ten years to buy a house. The day before the buy, they marry. The buy has been done only through that person's hard work and saving, but as there was a 1day marriage, it is now owned by both? And if that second person decides to leave for no good reason, that person get half a cut? That hardly seems fair.

So as I said, the division of property is a tricky case that requires more subtelty, and I don't know.

I have not too many issues with prenups provided that they were always upheld instead of being commonly dismissed by the judges whenever they want. From what I know, a prenup is about as valuable as the paper it is written on.

I guess the best thing is no attention from women because they think you automatically have a small dick, are anti-social, have no money, and are least desirable sexually. A substantial % of women would rather date outside their race if the guy's taller.

It's time to merge the Boy Scouts and and Girl Scouts and Guides in the US, as most nations have done for decades at this point. Not all dens, packs, patrols, or troops need to be 100% mixed, but the true ideals of Scouting aren't restricted to one gender."

Having worked in food rescue for a few years, if there is an easy way to donate food, everyone will do it. But it's not always easy. There's often additional costs associated with it, and neither food banks nor grocery stores have excess money to absorb too many of those excess costs.

Requiring people donate food won't help. Giving them small financial incentives will. In Minnesota, we give money to our farmers to cover the cost to pick and pack the produce they would typically plow over. It's a relatively minor budget item, and it's helped get literally millions of pounds of fresh produce into the food rescue system."

Until one day when a batch of something wasn't cooked correctly and went bad before it was served at the food bank. Unfortunately neither the food bank, nor the supplier caught this and the food was served. Many people got sick and some greedy, pushy lawyer sued the food supplier for some ridiculous amount ""on behalf of the sick folk.""

So now the supplier saves itself money by transporting all leftover food to either be sold and burned at a power plant or to be dumped."

I believe it's because you're focusing on your hands and not the stress and you're also feeling the water touch your skin. It works for me.

Noah is almost wholeheartedly for releasing the salaries, probably at least in part because Immortals is a new VC-backed company. For Noah, it's better this than nothing and it seems like nothing is the only alternative.

Bryce also clearly favors the publicized player salaries, but is approaching it from a practical/experienced look. The salary information is only a drop in the bucket of information that players really need to properly evaluate themselves.

Marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed, non-contextual, and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information.

My stance on this whole topic is that we're better served having the long, sometimes tough conversation than boiling down such an important and complex topic. That being said, if I had to summarize, I'd say that publicizing salaries is about giving players more information. Teams can and should push back about how that information is used (and vice versa). There is always going to be risk that data can be misused, but I don't think that justifies withholding the information."

The MSR7 don't isolate that well in loud environments.  The 1A would be better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass.

The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 wouldn't have enough bass if you're worried about bass on the MSR7.

I've had a lot of portables and I think the 1A may be best for you, especially considering reasonable Japan prices.  The Momentums are really laid back up top, the the m50x are more v-shaped that the 1A.

Noise cancellation is different and does well with these low notes since they're predictable. I'd say it's still enough. I've used them on a plane and the noise that did leak through was tolerable. Having to pop my ears was more annoying.

Noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic. The two waves cancel each other. Think like two ocean waves where the peak of one is at the trough of the other, both being the same distance from 0. If you put then on top of each other, it'll add to 0."

The HD558 are not nearly as sturdy and don't isolate...but they have a cleaner midrange and less bass/ treble. that means they sound more natural for movies, but lack the bass slam you want for EDM."

MMA started as a platform to test different styles of unarmed combat. No one got paid well until recently. Those that do have proven themselves repeatedly and have thus earned the interest of those that are entertained by it, so they are paid accordingly.

2876,d9hbrdc,5aj5z7,-0.417,CFP Predictions: What do you expect to be tonight's biggest surprises?,"> In that scenario, it would be incredibly clear you wouldn't deserve to be there.

Incredibly clear? Highly doubtful there'd be 4 teams that are ""clearly"" ahead of an undefeated Pac-12 champion. No way the committee puts both Michigan and Ohio State in."
2877,d9hck0f,5aj5z7,-0.438,CFP Predictions: What do you expect to be tonight's biggest surprises?,"Washington is ranked 9th.

1A. Wisconsin gets the fourth spot."
2878,d9hd9lc,5aj5z7,-0.298,CFP Predictions: What do you expect to be tonight's biggest surprises?,Biggest surprise will be THE ohio state university will be either 4th ahead of Washington or fifth ready to walk right into the play offs if they beat Michigan.
2879,d9hdbon,5aj5z7,-0.354,CFP Predictions: What do you expect to be tonight's biggest surprises?,"Perhaps clearly is too strong, but I think the one loss Michigan scenario with Utah imploding would likely go against Washington 

I think your biggest worry is Auburn and A&M both winning out with Auburn beating Bama at the Iron Bowl.  Then you have the SEC champ as Bama and a one loss A&M that can claim to have beaten that Auburn team, or you have a 1 loss A&M as the SEC champ and a 1 loss Bama with a win over the SEC champ.  That scenario is your worst case scenario "

2882,d9heapr,5aj5z7,-0.298,CFP Predictions: What do you expect to be tonight's biggest surprises?,I think we may be ranked lower than some expect due to the Georgia loss but this does not bother me so much as I realize that we still have three games left to play and any number of things can still go wrong.
2883,d9hg470,5aj5z7,-0.042,CFP Predictions: What do you expect to be tonight's biggest surprises?,"Louisville doesn't get much love because of SOS. Could potentially see them as low as 6 maybe even lower depending on how cruel they are.

First time Bama in the top 4 is a no-brainer. It'd be a shame if... the committee decided to... stir up some controversy (probably not happening, but one can hope).

Wahington *potentially* gets punished for SOS. Probably won't matter if they win the PAC-12 while undefeated or with one loss. I don't think they'll be left out of the top 4, though.

Strong emphasis on SOS could put Clemson as high as 1. Emphasis on the eye test could put as low as 4, but I doubt we'll be lower than 3."
2884,d9hibkn,5aj5z7,-0.25,CFP Predictions: What do you expect to be tonight's biggest surprises?,Louisville at 8 because they haven't beaten anybody.

3166,do4fbei,756rkp,-0.25,I just bricked my first linux system,"A number of people have suggested boot media and a refresh.

If the boot media isn't handy, or you want to give yourself a bit of an extra challenge, edit your grub prompt to boot to `init=/bin/bash`.  This will, rather than starting systemd to bring you your system, start bash.  This has the effect of pretty much only requiring a working kernel, but also requires you to bring up anything you need (read-write access to your disks, any partitions other than /, networking) manually, yourself.

Also, ctl-C doesn't work, and there are no extra terminals (unless you make them), so don't run anything that might not terminate on its own."
3167,do4fckt,756rkp,-0.283,I just bricked my first linux system,"It's not bricked. Boot any live-cd and you should be able to recover, or mount and backup your files before re-installing. It's nigh-on impossible to brick a PC as others have said. 

Unless you were doing something quite unusual your files should be located in `/home/{username}`, perhaps `/var/www` as well"
3168,do4fqcb,756rkp,-0.333,I just bricked my first linux system,"It's extremely rare to ""brick"" a modern Linux-based OS. The problem is just usually more effort than its worth to fix.

3169,do4if9o,756rkp,-0.229,I just bricked my first linux system,Probably already suggested but if you have another computer and a flash drive install Linux on the flash drive and boot from that then start recovery.

3177,do5jlkx,756rkp,0.083,I just bricked my first linux system,"I've never tried it myself. The idea is neat but, at least for me, YAGNI.

The *very* few instances where I really needed a specific `.so` that my system didn't provide I could easily solve that manually via either symlinks or `LD_PRELOAD`ing.

Their way of configuration management seems *weird* to me, but that might just be me neckbearding and clinging to the tried-and-old ways."
3178,do5vamu,756rkp,-0.417,I just bricked my first linux system,"My 2 cents:
- buy a powerful pc (i7, a lot of ram)
- install win10 pro (yes I am not jocking, a terrible OS but with a powerful type 1 hypervisor)
- Activate Hyper-V and install whatever Linux distro you want
- take a snapshot

You will be able to play with your OS, ""brick"" whenever you want, and come back to the original version in just few clicks. Without ever corrupting the main os or other images.

Plus, you will avoid every hardware incompatibility headache."

Of course it does. Fallen has won alot more because he played in a way better team meanwhile k0nfig has played in a team much worse and therefore lost alot more resulting in a lower rating. 

> fallen was a better entry

oh please, k0nfig is much better as a pure entry. Fallens opening kill stats are better because he is an awper and awpers usually tends to have a higher opening kill stats.

its alot easier to be more consistent when you are playing in the #1 team with two top5 players in it compared to k0nfig playing in North while being a very aggressive player

As long as you recognize that, it seems perfectly fine. It seems like y'all are happy!

To the spoiling thing, just do things she knows she'll love. If she likes a good meal, make that. If she likes to come home to a made bed and clean bathroom, do that.

Then just keep near and attack once to keep him attacking and ull get the last deflect to finish him off. Definitely learn to deflect his jumping slam and the follow up mikiri counter on his charged stab. In the final stage mikiri his diving stab to get easy hits early and use it to fill up his posture for the final blow. Then lose your shit when u finally get that final blow.

The game does a pretty great job of playing in to that feeling, doesn’t it? I often say a last “fuck you” to the boss as the brutal death animation plays. Bonus points if I had been using the flame sword combo and the death animation plays with my flaming sword impaling the boss."

Its where the world opens up and you get freedom in the order to do levels its where magic opens up. Its the story really gets interesting and. You can finally cure dragonrot.  The game is difficult. But it becomes MUCH more manageable.  Its just such a hurdle because its 10 TIMES tougher then everything you've seen before

I joke I carry a weighted vest because I could stand to lose 20-25 lbs and on my frame it looks like 40 extra lbs. But it’s funny to end up on leader board for 200m row or sub 7 mile and mentally be like AHA! Bet you didn’t see that cushy lady coming!"

The reason Gold Coast sits outside that group though, IMO, is their list. Everyone there is either young, or not great.

As she grows I see her making adult decisions, showing empathy for others, and succeeding both academically and physically in sports. Her curiosity has never been stifled by the phrase, ""you can't do that because you're a girl"", so she is allowed to explore and grow on her own. To her, gender is merely a biological/physical circumstance and in no way inhibits her ability to succeed. She never ceases to amaze me and I have no doubts that if she wanted to, she could be president. By seeing this, it has taught me that determination, intelligence, physical prowess, and love for others cannot be judged based on gender. It's hard to say ""I respect [name]"" at the age of 10, but in this case, I do."

Maybe in your country, but the U.S. courts have not struck down all laws that differentiate men and women by anatomy. Rape laws are another example where some states define rape purely in terms of penetration such that sometimes only people with vaginas can be raped, sometimes only people with penises can commit rape, etc. based on the wording of the law. States are slowly changing them, but none of the old laws that define it on anatomy have been struck down by the courts, AFAIK."

So many children go in and out of the foster care system because there are unfit parents/foster parents that these poor kids get shuffled around and usually experience tragic events due to lack of parenting skills. Not saying that's the case in every scenario but why bring a child into the world if you know you cant properly support it. Yes they could be adopted into a nice family, but how about we work on getting the abandoned children we have now into good homes vs adding more to the list.

But there is a huge difference between letting someone in power decide which opinion you can and which opinions you cannot publish, and punishing publishing what is objectively false information.

Comparing the US to, say, the UK we have 11.3% more of our population that's obese. That would correlate with a 0.339 year difference in longevity.

The United States has an average longevity of 79.3 years. In the United Kingdom it's 81.2, or 1.9 years longer. Thus cursory analysis would show obesity differences account for about 19% of the total.

The more striking difference is the difference in cost. The UK achieves that average while spending $5,963 less per person per year on healthcare. That's $472,866 less over a typical lifetime for an individual. "

Also my student loans make it so I might be able to leave my parents house when I'm 28. I'm 22 and it feels like I'm going to start my independent life when I'm almost 30 and that is incredibly depressing. I feel like I'm wasting my youth away because I have to work off student loans for a college I was forced to go to.

If we go down the path of what socialism is, we are done.  Trump gets shit on the way he conveys but look at the policies and laws that he is simply enabling that assists this country from going down.  Mass migration/Globalism is NOT the answer for long term stability.  You can't manage HATE.  You make laws and build protection against HATE.  IE. fences around the elementary school playground.  A small group of people in control of Earth is not the answer.

This sign is representative of brainwashing MS media hate of trump that is purchased by a much deeper evil that most of the world buries its head in the sand from."
